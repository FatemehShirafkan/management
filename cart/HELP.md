### Cart Service

Use other services as a client with the help of @EnableFeignClients annotation. This Java code defines a Feign client interface named ProductClient. Feign is a declarative web service client developed by Netflix that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests.

In summary, this code defines a Feign client interface for interacting with a hypothetical "product-service" through the "/getProducts/{title}" endpoint, allowing the retrieval of product information based on a provided title. The base URL for the service is configured dynamically in the application configuration.
